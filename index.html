      <h3><a href="#">December Meetup</a></h3>
      <p>Join us December 17th to hear from two talented local designers and engineers speaking about their process and recent work:</p>
<p>
Jonathan Bobrow is a research assistant at the MIT Media Lab's Playful Systems Group. He's the mind behind Automitiles - http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/AutomaTiles - and will be speaking about Systems Tinkering: "The spaces with which we think are largely shaped by the tools and toys we are exposed to or the kind of coordinate systems we play in. We will explore my work and process of inventing new ways of playing with alternate geometries and complex systems, and the happy accidents that have guided my design and development along the way."
</p><p>
Dana Busch's work focuses on sustainability, urban planning, public health, and community/design partnerships. Her most recent collaboration, Tidraphone, was on display in Fort Point through the Fall. Dana will be talking about the concept, the process, and what it's like to work with the City of Boston on a semi-permanent interactive piece on a public bridge over Coast Guard waters. </p>
