<p>
Victoria Shen - http://www.evicshen.com/</p>
<p>
Victoria is a Somerville-based multimedia artist and musician whose work is positioned at the intersection of art history, pop culture, and identity politics. She constructs interactive video/sound installations which layer and saturate appropriated media to produce new critical readings. Through a process of visual exaggeration and effacement, her video work holds up a mirror to the absurd side of images we consume. Shen's talk will discuss the strained yet harmonious relationship between art and technology within her own practice and the way technology reproduces our sexual and violent fantasies. 
</p>
<br/>
<p>Nick Chelyapov - http://www.curioussoundobjects.com/</p>
Nick is the founder of Curious Sound Objects, an outlet for the various interactive sound forms coming out of Cambridge and Somerville in Massachusetts. Nick will present about the objects he's constructed as well as the community he's creaetd.

        <article class="description">

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/158731769">Joelle Bitton @Boston Tech Poetics</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user49921287">Joelle Bitton</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>
Joelle is an artist, designer and HCI researcher, currently enrolled as a DDes candidate at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. For her presentation, "Living in the Material World", she has this to say: "I look at personal data and digital fabrication and I see creative opportunities arising. I’m proposing to use human-based data as parameters for CNC-machining. Twipology and Rabota are two recent projects that suggest that digital fabrication can be unprecise, slow, non-linear but... on purpose. Overall, the point is to establish a daily relationship with technology that is intimate and disruptive at the same time."
</p>
<br/>
<p>Matthew Tytel - http://tytel.org/</p>
Matt is a music and virtual reality software developer. He is a former Leap Motion employee where he created interactive physics toys ranging from centipedes, to pluckable flowers. In his presentation titled "Playful Physics Toys - in 3D!", Matt will go through the long term process of developing interactive physical objects that started with simple blocks and ended with constructing dance robots.

       <p>
Eitan Mendelowitz - 
<a href="http://www.eitanm.com/">http://www.eitanm.com/</a></p>
<p>
Eitan is an Assistant Professor of Computing and the Arts at Smith College where his creative research and art production inform his teaching of algorithmic art and computer science. As a recent transplant to the Boston area, I'm excited to introduce him to the community. Eitan will be giving us a tour of his work with: Lessons learned in 18 years of creating interactive installations.</p>
<p>
Saba Ghole -
Co-founder, <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/">NuVu Studio</a></p>
<p>
Saba is an artist, designer and entrepreneur. Her latest project, Pulse and Bloom, is an interactive and social art installation that visualizes participants’ heartbeats, and invites people to share and sync their heartbeats in a rhythmic pattern. Pulse and Bloom is one of the largest biofeedback installations of its kind, allowing a group of 40 people to visualize their heartbeats simultaneously. Pulse and Bloom received the Burning Man Honorarium Art Grant in 2014. After its premier at the Burning Man Festival in Black Rock City, Nevada, Pulse and Bloom began a world tour, bringing the installation to festivals and galleries across three continents. In her talk, Saba will discuss the process of designing and building an interactive art piece of this nature, and the multidisciplinary team that spans across multiple cities (Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Bangalore, and London).</p>

        <h3>12/17/2015 - Jonathan Bobrow & Dana Busch</h3>
        <article class="description">
		 <img src="images/BTPDecember2015.png" alt="October 2015 Demo Night" />
       <p>
Jonathan Bobrow is a research assistant at the MIT Media Lab's Playful Systems Group. He's the mind behind <a href="http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/AutomaTiles">Automatiles</a> and will be speaking about Systems Tinkering: "The spaces with which we think are largely shaped by the tools and toys we are exposed to or the kind of coordinate systems we play in. We will explore my work and process of inventing new ways of playing with alternate geometries and complex systems, and the happy accidents that have guided my design and development along the way."
</p>
<p>
Dana Busch's work focuses on sustainability, urban planning, public health, and community/design partnerships. Her most recent collaboration, Tidraphone, was on display in Fort Point through the Fall. Dana will be talking about the concept, the process, and what it's like to work with the City of Boston on a semi-permanent interactive piece on a public bridge over Coast Guard waters. </p>
