  descri: "Miriam Simun is an artist whose work spans video, sculpture, scent,
          food, writing, public performance and numerous other disciplines.
          Often based in ethnographic, historical and scientific research,
          her work has been called “Performance as Research/Research as Performance.”
          Among her chief concerns are are attending to sensorial, embodied forms
          of knowledge; exploring the messy complexities and contradictory poetics
          residing at the intersection of Nature/Culture/Power; and developing
          the means to imagine alternate futures."

  descri: "Dr. Smith's research interests are in computational creativity,
          game design, computer science education, and the intersection of
          traditional crafts and computation. Her interdisciplinary work merges
          technical research in AI and HCI with creative practice in textiles
          and games, with a view towards addressing social issues and broadening
          participation and perspectives on computing."
