His practice consists of experiments with virtual/augmented reality, projection mapping, geodesic domes, large-scale displays and digital fabrication. Driven by an interdisciplinary thinking which extends to art, design and science, his work focuses on human perception, exploring new methods for non-linear narratives and emergent forms."

- subtitle: "Daniel Sabio"
  website: "[thegladscientist.info](http://thegladscientist.info/)"
  descri: "The Glad Scientist is the pseudonym of Puerto Rican new media artist Daniel Sabio. His creations are constellations of the joyful augmentation of humanness through technology, ranging from live VR/AV performances to computer vision and EEG art installations. Thematically, science fiction and a criticality towards technology remain prevalent, often posing questions on what it means to be human in the exaggerated futures that await."
