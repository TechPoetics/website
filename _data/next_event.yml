    descri: Some bodies do some things, and others do others. Prosthetics,
            bodily capacity, expanded engineering and creative research,
            flexible adaptation, possible futures, interdependence, collaborative
            design, inclusive systems, productive uncertainty, and critical makingâ€”these
            things drive my work. At this talk, I want to explore ways to expand work
            on disability and technology into some newer uncharted territory.
