#   descri: "Zach Lieberman is an artist, researcher and educator with a simple goal: he wants you surprised.  In his work, he creates performances and installations that take human gesture as input and amplify them in different ways -- making drawings come to life, imagining what the voice might look like if we could see it, transforming peoples silhouettes into music.  He's been listed as one of Fast Company's Most Creative People and his projects have won the Golden Nica from Ars Electronica,  Interactive Design of the Year from Design Museum London as well as listed in Time Magazine's Best Inventions of the Year.  He creates artwork through writing software and is a co-creator of openFrameworks, an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding and helped co-found the School for Poetic Computation, a school examining the lyrical possibilities of code."

#   descri: "Caitlin is a designer and researcher, focused on perception, sensation, and the human-environment relationship. Her work ranges from explorations in physical space, taking the form of large-scale sculptures designed to bring unexpected phenomena into the built environment, to human-scale research around cognition and perception. Sheâ€™s excited about moments where surprising modalities in perception emerge out of symbiosis between an individual and their surroundings."
