He's been listed as one of Fast Company's Most Creative People and his projects have won the Golden Nica from Ars Electronica,  Interactive Design of the Year from Design Museum London as well as listed in Time Magazine's Best Inventions of the Year.  He creates artwork through writing software and is a co-creator of openFrameworks, an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding and helped co-found the School for Poetic Computation, a school examining the lyrical possibilities of code."

More than half of the almost fifty studios she has taught relate to designing for the body through topics such as assistive devices, speculative prosthetics, fashion and dance. When she worked as an architect, the building sites she designed for were flat planes--the ground. Her current work is affixed to the body: a contoured, fleshy, expanding, contracting site that is in motion. Her latest projects are focused on this site of attachment."

      presentation, 'Living in the Material World', she has this to say.
      'I look at personal data and digital fabrication and I see creative
      opportunities arising. I’m proposing to use human-based data as parameters
      for CNC-machining. Twipology and Rabota are two recent projects that
      suggest that digital fabrication can be unprecise, slow, non-linear
      but... on purpose. Overall, the point is to establish a daily relationship
      with technology that is intimate and disruptive at the same time.'

      of the largest biofeedback installations of its kind, allowing a
      group of 40 people to visualize their heartbeats simultaneously.
      Pulse and Bloom received the Burning Man Honorarium Art Grant in 2014.
      After its premier at the Burning Man Festival in Black Rock City, Nevada,
      Pulse and Bloom began a world tour, bringing the installation to festivals
      and galleries across three continents. In her talk, Saba will discuss
      the process of designing and building an interactive art piece of this
      nature, and the multidisciplinary team that spans across multiple cities
      (Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Bangalore, and London).

    descri: Jonathan Bobrow is a research assistant at the MIT Media Lab's
      Playful Systems Group. He's the mind behind <a href='http://cargo.jonathanbobrow.com/AutomaTiles'>Automatiles</a>
      and will be speaking about Systems Tinkering. 'The spaces with which
      we think are largely shaped by the tools and toys we are exposed to
      or the kind of coordinate systems we play in. We will explore my work
      and process of inventing new ways of playing with alternate geometries
      and complex systems, and the happy accidents that have guided my design
      and development along the way.'
